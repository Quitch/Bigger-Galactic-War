# Bigger Galactic War

This mod works with both Planetary Annihilation and Planetary Annihilation Titans. It introduces larger planets, systems, and galaxies for Galactic War. You may find your war takes longer to load at the larger sizes, especially during the initial galaxy generation so please be patient.

## Installation

This mod can be installed via the in-game Community Mod manager.

## How To Use

Start a new Galactic War and you will find the new galaxy sizes on the drop down menu.
